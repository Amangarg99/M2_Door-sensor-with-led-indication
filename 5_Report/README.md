# Door sensor with LED indication 

door sensor also known as contact sensor or window sensor Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know when someone is entering your home. These devices are made up of two parts, which form a circuit when theyâ€™re kept parallel to each other. When someone opens the door, the two parts separate and break the circuit, which triggers the control panel to sound an alarm with LED indication

Reed switches are used in countless devices, from doorbells to doorsensors, and rely on a set of electrical connectors. The switch is closed when the two parts are sitting close to one another, and an electric current can flow. When the switch opens, the two parts separate, causing the electrical current to stop and the circuit to deactivate.
